# Purpose
The online student portal serves as a dedicated platform for teachers and students, aiming to streamline academic management and facilitate effective communication within the educational institution. Its key purposes include:

**Attendance Management:** Teachers can efficiently upload and manage student attendance records. This feature enables teachers to keep track of students' regularity and punctuality, ensuring accurate attendance records for administrative purposes.

**Sessional Examination Marks:** Teachers can input sessional examination marks and grades directly into the portal. Students can access their performance data, allowing them to gauge their progress and identify areas for improvement. This feature promotes a data-driven approach to academic evaluation.

**Hall Ticket Distribution:** The portal facilitates the secure distribution of hall tickets for various examinations. Students can easily access and download their hall tickets, ensuring they are well-prepared for exams and aware of the necessary details.

By focusing on the teacher-student interaction, the online portal optimizes administrative tasks and promotes a more efficient and accountable learning environment within the institution.
